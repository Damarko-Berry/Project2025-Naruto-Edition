Since she was a little girl, she dreamed of working with them, even writing in third grade that she wanted to be a vet tech one day. Her dream came true in 2013 when she graduated with a degree in veterinary science, filling her family with so much pride. Amberly never stopped learning and always found ways to deepen her knowledge.\r\n\r\nHer creativity was a beautiful part of who she was, too. She loved baking and crafting, and her family still treasures the pieces of art she made, displayed throughout their home as reminders of her talent and spirit. But behind her bright spirit, Amberly struggled. Anxiety first touched her life in high school, leading her to try Xanax to calm her mind—a choice that opened the door to further struggles with addiction.\r\n\r\nAmberly’s heart had been through so much. She lost close friends to addiction and mourned her first love, losses that weighed heavily on her. She tried hard to break free, but each heartbreak seemed to pull her back. In 2018, she faced a devastating ectopic pregnancy, losing the child she longed for and learning that her dream of being a mother would require IVF. Her family offered to support her with IVF if she could find her way to sobriety, giving her a small hope. \r\n\r\nThen, in early 2020, the world seemed to collapse around her. She lost both grandparents within weeks, and the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic made it even harder to get the help she needed. She kept trying, but the weight of it all became too much. Her last Facebook post read, “Learning to love myself again has been my greatest gift.” Just two days later, she was gone.\r\n\r\nAmberly’s family carries her in their hearts, feeling the emptiness of her absence every day. She is missed beyond words and loved beyond measure.\r\n",

After moving in with her boyfriend, she found some clean time, and together they dreamed of a fresh start. Ashley became pregnant, and for a while, hope filled her days as she looked forward to a future with her child. Tragically, she lost the baby at four months, a loss that broke her heart in a way that words couldn’t express. Returning to using, she and her boyfriend struggled to hold onto the life they had built, but addiction's relentless grip took it all away. Ashley was a deeply loving person who carried the weight of her struggles alone for so long. She ultimately lost her life to a fentanyl overdose at 35 years old, leaving behind loved ones who will remember her for the kindness she showed despite her own pain and the laughter she shared even on her hardest days.\r\n",

Known for his exceptional skills as a logger, he had the talent to drop a tree with precision, claiming he could land it between two pennies and still give you change.\r\n\r\nSadly, Ernest lost his life to addiction in April 2015 at the age of 45. He is now reunited with his son, Baby Ernie, who was born sleeping in 1990 due to complications from his mother’s addiction. Their story serves as a reminder of the devastating toll addiction can take on families, and they are remembered with love and deep respect. I am sharing their story on behalf of his wife, and the mother of baby Ernie.\r\n",

Jake struggled with addiction, but in the months before he passed, it seemed like he was finally finding what he’d been searching for all along. He had just started a job he loved, one that would let him travel and experience new things, and he was so excited for what was ahead. He’d been clean for a while, and it felt like he was finally beginning to see the light.\r\n\r\nJake loved the outdoors. He felt at home in the woods and fields, whether he was hunting, fishing, mushroom hunting, or working on the farm. He treasured the time he spent with his family and friends, who he held close to his heart and loved dearly.\r\n\r\nIn one of his last messages, as he faced the struggles that addiction brings, he reached out to someone and asked, \"bring me some heroin.\" And then he added, \"This is the last time.\"\r\n\r\nJake was so much more than his addiction. He was a beloved son, a bright spirit, and a loyal friend. He will be deeply missed and remembered with love by all who knew him.\r\n",

He cherished the simple moments with his son, Kylan—cuddling, hanging out, or just watching him grow. His face would light up with the purest smile whenever Kylan did something new. “It’s crazy, he’s learning this just from watching us, huh?” he’d say, amazed by his son’s growing curiosity.\r\n\r\nHe dreamed about the future, especially the day he’d take Kylan mudding. It was something he was so excited to share with his little boy. Now, six months later, Kylan says, “I’m big enough, Dad,” but Kyle won’t be the one to take him. Instead, his mom will carry out Kyle’s dream in his honor.\r\n\r\nKyle faced struggles of his own, battles with his mental health that made things difficult. But despite his challenges, over the last few years, he worked hard to be a better person—for himself and for his kids. He found new purpose as a father, determined not to repeat past mistakes. He held onto two things he wanted more than anything:\r\n\r\nTo reconnect with his daughter, Kamdyn.\r\n\r\nTo be the best father he could to Kylan, giving him the life he deserved.\r\n\r\n",

One night while playing pool, a friend jokingly called him \"Hopsing\" because of his ponytail, and Bill embraced it with joy, showcasing his fun-loving nature.\r\n\r\nTragically, Bill passed away when his only known child, Kirsten, was just 10 years old. She never had the chance to truly know her dad, which is a heartbreaking loss for their family. Another close friend remembered, “He always knew how much he meant to me and my family. We had so many great times together, especially during karaoke nights!” Bill’s laughter and love created lasting memories for those who shared their lives with him.\r\n\r\nHis favorite song, \"Live Like You Were Dying\" by Tim McGraw, reflects his spirit—he believed in celebrating every day and bringing joy to those around him. Bill worked as a State Tested Nursing Assistant (STNA), caring for older adults with kindness and dedication.\r\n\r\nLarry \"Bill\" Sammons, Jr. is survived by his loving sisters, Brenda and Pamela; his daughter, Kirsten; and his beloved nieces, Michelle and Melissa, along with his nephew, Warren, and many great-nieces, great-nephews, and friends. His legacy of love, laughter, and kindness will always be cherished by those who knew him.\r\n\r\nMay his memory inspire others to celebrate life and share joy with one another.\r\n",

Her laughter could brighten even the heaviest of hearts, and her love was boundless, wrapping around her momma like a warm embrace.\r\n\r\nTo her mom, Randi was everything—her baby, her only daughter, her reason to smile. Though life now feels unbearably quiet, Randi’s spirit lingers in every gentle breeze, in the sunlight that spills across the earth, and in the memories that will forever bloom like wildflowers in her mother’s heart.\r\n\r\nRandi had a way of leaving her mark, of making ordinary moments feel extraordinary. Her love lives on in the little things: the songs that remind you of her, the places she loved, the sound of her name whispered into the night sky.\r\n\r\n\"Forever 34,\" but forever so much more—Randi will always be her momma’s greatest treasure, her angel, and her best friend. Though the world feels emptier without her, the bond they share remains unbreakable, stretching beyond time and space.\r\n\r\nSleep peacefully, sweet Tune. Your momma will love you for all of her days, and your memory will shine in her heart until you meet again.\r\n",

    "LongDescript": "Tommie Ray Turner was a force of nature, a man whose charm and charisma could brighten even the darkest days. His smile was magnetic, lighting up every room he walked into. With his carefree spirit, Tommie lived boldly, unapologetically himself, and never concerned about what others thought of him. He had an incredible way of making everyone feel seen and valued—Tommie never met a stranger.\r\n\r\nGenerosity was at the core of who Tommie was. He’d give you the shirt off his back or his last bite of food without a second thought. His heart was as big as his personality, and those who were fortunate enough to know him saw the depth of his kindness and compassion.\r\n\r\nTommie fought hard against the grip of addiction for many years, but ultimately, fentanyl took him away far too soon. A drug so powerful and dangerous, it is often a death sentence when found on the streets. To those who loved him, this loss feels unbearable. He was so much more than his struggles—a brother, a friend, and a light in the lives of many.\r\n\r\nTommie is missed deeply by everyone he left behind. The love his family carries for him will never fade, and his memory will live on as a reminder of the person he was: one of a kind, generous, and irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nRest easy, Tommie. You are forever loved by those you left behind.\r\n",
